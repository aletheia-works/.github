# Organization-level configuration for aletheia-works.
#
# All org-scoped resources live here: org settings, Actions policy,
# memberships, and the security-managers team. Consolidated into a
# single file because the total surface is small enough that splitting
# by resource type costs more in navigation than it saves in focus.
# variables.tf, providers.tf, and versions.tf stay separate per the
# OpenTofu convention.
#
# `.github` repository-scoped resources (branch protection, repo
# settings, CODEOWNERS) deliberately live in the sibling
# `infra/dotgithub/` module so org and repo state evolve independently.


# ─── Org settings ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Import (one-time, manual) before the first apply if the live org
# pre-existed this module:
#   tofu import github_organization_settings.this aletheia-works
#
# Values declared here must match the live UI state at import time;
# otherwise the first apply will silently overwrite live settings.
# `tofu plan` shows any drift before apply.

  # ─── Member permissions ──────────────────────────────────────
  # Only admins (organization owners) can create repositories. Members
  # cannot create repos of any visibility and cannot fork private repos.
  # The org is currently solo-developed so the practical blast radius is
  # zero, but these defaults are the right ones to hand off to a future
  # team and avoid accidental public creation.

  # ─── GitHub Pages ────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Enable public Pages so repositories (vivarium, future sub-projects)
  # can publish docs sites. This is an *organization-level* gate: even
  # org owners cannot enable Pages on a repo while the org toggle is off.
  #
  # NOTE: GitHub couples `members_can_create_private_pages` to the
  # parent `members_can_create_pages` toggle — enabling the parent flips
  # private_pages to true on the API side even if the API request set it
  # to false. Keeping all three aligned at `true` to avoid infinite
  # drift. Private Pages are unreachable in practice on the Free plan
  # (private repos can't host Pages), so this is cosmetic.

  # ─── Projects (classic) / Project boards ─────────────────────
  # Org-level Projects classic board is enabled so the "vivarium roadmap"
  # GitHub Projects v2 board surfaces under the org. Repository-level
  # classic Projects stay on as well — `vivarium` uses them for some
  # views.
  has_organization_projects = true
  has_repository_projects   = true

  # ─── Commit integrity ────────────────────────────────────────
  # Enforce sign-off for every commit across every repo in the org. Repos
  # inherit this and cannot turn it off. The provider used to spuriously
  # send web_commit_signoff_required=false in repo PATCH bodies and trip a
  # 422; integrations/github v6.12.0 fixed that, so downstream repo
  # resources no longer need the lifecycle.ignore_changes workaround.

  # ─── Default security hardening for new repos ────────────────
  # These only affect repositories created *after* the setting flips. For
  # existing repos, enable at the repo level. GitHub Advanced Security is
  # a paid add-on and stays off.

  # actions remain automatically allowed via the booleans below.

  # Force every third-party action invocation to be pinned by commit SHA

# ─── Memberships ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Only owners (admins) are pinned in code; regular members can be added
# via the UI without requiring a Tofu round-trip. If/when the project
# grows past solo development, convert the members list into its own
# variable and add a `github_membership` per member with role="member".

# ─── Security managers ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Designating a team as "security manager" gives its members:
#   - Read access to security alerts (Dependabot, code scanning,
#     secret scanning) across every repository in the org
#   - Write access to security configurations
# without making them org admins. Closes the ghqr finding `org-sec-005`
# ("No security manager team assigned").

  # future members) without going through the org-admin path. Switch to
  # `member` for additional non-leading members once the team grows.
  role = "maintainer"
}


# ── Settings that are NOT managed here ──────────────────────────────────
#
# The integrations/github provider (as of v6.12) does not expose the
# following org attributes. They are set via the GitHub UI / REST and
# documented here so the source of truth is still discoverable:
#
# • two_factor_requirement_enabled = true
#     Org-level 2FA enforcement. Set at /organizations/<org>/settings/security.
#
# • default_workflow_permissions = "read"                  (Actions → General)
#   can_approve_pull_request_reviews = false
#     Least-privilege GITHUB_TOKEN for all workflows.
#
# • members_can_delete_repositories = true                 (Repo policies)
# • members_can_change_repo_visibility = true
# • members_can_invite_outside_collaborators = true
# • members_can_delete_issues = false
# • display_commenter_full_name_setting_enabled = false
# • readers_can_create_discussions = true
# • members_can_create_teams = true
# • members_can_view_dependency_insights = true
# • deploy_keys_enabled_for_repositories = false
# • members_allowed_repository_creation_type = "none"
#     (Legacy aggregate field; practically covered by the per-visibility
#     members_can_create_*_repositories booleans set above.)
#
# Team / Enterprise-plan-only and therefore out of scope on Free:
# • Organization Rulesets
# • Custom repository roles
#
# When the provider adds coverage for any of the above, migrate it into
# this file and drop the corresponding line from this block.
